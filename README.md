# tailwindCss-landing-page
First experience with tailwindcss framework
I can say welcome  "tailwindCss" to my my world, we thank Adam Wathan for this beauty worth experiencing https://adamwathan.me/
in my opinion this framework is very suitable for css lovers, it is easy to work and at the same time it is not far from css native (without frameworks). 
Yes, there are a lot of html classes and  it's maybe this not good but deal with css by tailwind css make things bettwe and you can easiy customizing it.
